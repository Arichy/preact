# Follow ups

* `[MAJOR]` Remove select `<option>` IE11 fix in diffChildren and tell users to
  always specify a value attribute for `<option>`. History:
  https://github.com/preactjs/preact/pull/1838
* One possible implementation for effect queues: Internal nodes can have a local
  queue of effects for that node while a global queue contains the internal
  nodes that have effects.
* Feature: Top-level render handles Fragment root
* Figure out a way to externally support the use case of "start rendering at
  this child of parentDom" (in other words, remove all that code from core &
  recommend folks use
  [this technique](https://gist.github.com/developit/f321a9ef092ad39f54f8d7c8f99eb29a))
* Remove the need for `excessDomChildren`. Do hydration more similarly to
  `keyed` if possible.
* Golf everything! Look for @TODO(golf)
* Unbreak Suspense and Portals ðŸ˜…
